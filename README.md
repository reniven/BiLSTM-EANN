# BiLSTM-EANN

Research project at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln creating on an event agonistic model based on [EANN: Event Adversarial Neural Networks for Multi-Modal Fake News Detection](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3219819.3219903). This project tries to improve upon this work by adding two new modification to the model; a new input for social-context data and reconfigure the text and image models to VSM and ResNet.
